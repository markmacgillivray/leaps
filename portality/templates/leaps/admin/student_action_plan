                        as well as speaking to lecturers and current students about their experiences of the course and institution. 
                        We recommend getting the full benefit of Open Days by attending in person if you can, 
                        don't worry if this isn't an option for you - universities and colleges often offer online/virtual open days; 
                        keep an eye on their websites for updates.</p>
